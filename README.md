# WhatsApp desktop app for linux

  [WhatsApp-web](https://web.whatsapp.com/) wrapped in Electron to open as a desktop app. Since linux doesn't have a lot of apps.
 
___
This app does not modify or use any direct code from One Note. Just uses [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) to open a browser window, and serve it as a desktop application since Linux does not have an official releases of some apps. Uses Electron's BowserView to display third-party webpage/webapp.

Started because I prefer using separate apps, and not opening everything in my browser. And, because I hate using Ubuntu's dock, and I'd rather have it open in a window of its own and easily accessible from the dock.
